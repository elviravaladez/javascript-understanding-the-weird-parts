# JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts

This is a repository to document what I've learned while taking the [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/) Udemy course by [Anthony Alicea](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/#instructor-1).

### Course Objectives
- Grasp how JavaScript works, and it's fundamental concepts
- Write solid JavaScript code
- Understand advanced concepts such as closures, prototypal inheritance, IIFEs, etc.
- Drastically improve ability to debug problems in JavaScript
- Avoid common JavaScript pitfalls and mistakes
- Understand the source code of popular JavaScript frameworks

### What I've Learned

#### JavaScript and `undefined`
It is recommended to NEVER set a variable's value to `undefined`. Following this practice makes it easier to debug because, as a developer, you are now able to associate `undefined` with "I've never set the value of this variable."

❌ Don't do this️
```js
var a = undefined;
```

JavaScript is single threaded, synchronous execution in its behavior.

- Single Threaded: One command at a time
- Synchronous: One at a time
